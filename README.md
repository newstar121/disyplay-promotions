## Work History

At first, I started this project from react version 16 project.<br />
During the development, I encounted npm package conflict issue due to low react version.<br />
So I updated react version from 16 to 18.

I had 72 hours to finish this test project but because of several problems in weekend, I only worked a few hours on this project.<br />
I know there are so many things to update.

## Environment

node v18.16.1

Before start project, you should install npm pacakge using following command.<br />

### cd display-promotions<br />

### npm install

To start projet. use this.<br />

### npm run start

## Technologies and library choices

In this project, I aim to build well-structured project.
You will noticed about that once you look at my code.

Also, I used following technical stacks and libraries.

- React, Hook, Context, Provider, Restful API
- Custom css, React-bootstrap
- framer-motion package

As I mentioned above, I started from react version 16 project and found drag & drop component.
I tried to install framer-motion package but it isn't allowed in react version 16 and project crashed.
So I migrate the project from version 16 to 18.

I have enough experience in Tailwind css but I selected custom css to show my css skills.
